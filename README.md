Blog WebApiFormatters
=====================

Blog Post: [ASP.Net WebAPI - Controlling Response Formats](http://blogs.lessthandot.com/index.php/WebDev/ServerProgramming/ASPNET/asp-net-webapi-controlling-response)

This code is a sample project to show two methods for changing the formatter used for 
output from ASP.net MVC4 Web API methods. A sample Index.html page is available with
jQuery calls to test the 3 API actions. The projects makes XML the default format by
switching the order of te formatters, then forces two actions to output specific 
formats by directly specifying them in the response.
